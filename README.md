# Mist App
This is a simple MicroPython program that will set a Relay to on after a number of 
minutes have elapsed as set in `cycle_time`.

The relay will remain on for the number of seconds defined in `sleep_seconds`

You can play with these two variables during testing so you don't have to wait a full 4 hours between Mist cycles.
